Playball-game was created by "MafiaJs" team, the main purpose was to enchance JavaScript skills and get first exepriance in team project.
It's the falling ball game, in order to win the user has to score(kill) as many balls as he can, before they fall down otherwise he loses.

The project ended-up unfinished and dusted. After few months I decided to work on it in order to complate the demo version. 
App is hosted by github pages on https://anuradis.github.io/playball-game/

Techstack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
