Playball-game was created by "MafiaJs" team. The main purpose was to enchance JavaScript skills and get first experience in team project.
It's the falling ball game; in order to win the user has to score (kill) as many balls as he can, before they fall down. 

The project ended-up unfinished and dusted. After few months, I decided to work on it in order to complete the demo version. 
The app is hosted on github pages. URL: https://anuradis.github.io/playball-game/

Techstack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
